### 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates student perceptions of the effectiveness of **college-provided resources** (in-person classes, library, office hours) vs. **non-college resources** (YouTube, ChatGPT, online articles) in supporting academic success and engagement.

We surveyed **103 students** from diverse departments and academic years at CSUEB and performed detailed **exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and bootstrapping** to reveal trends and differences in perceived effectiveness.

### Steps

- **Survey Design:** Custom survey developed to test the core hypothesis
- **Data Collection:** Anonymous responses collected across campus  
- **EDA:** Visualization of usage trends by year and department  
- **Bootstrapping:** 1,500 samples generated for more robust statistical inference  
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Proportion tests and chi-square tests to evaluate group differences  
- **Visualization:** Donut charts, bar plots, treemaps, and stacked percentages

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **R**: dplyr, ggplot2, gtsummary, RColorBrewer, treemapify
- **Statistical Methods**: Bootstrapping, two-sample proportion tests, chi-square tests
- **Data Size**: 103 original responses, ~150,000 bootstrapped records

---

### 📈 Key Findings

- **Both resources are valued**: ~40% of students found both college and non-college resources effective  
- **With bootstrapping**, college resources were slightly more favored (95% CI: 3.8%–4.7% higher)  
- **Preferences vary by department and academic year**  
- **Students in advanced years** showed stronger preferences for dual-resource effectiveness

---

### 📝 Conclusion

Students benefit most from a **hybrid approach** combining traditional and online learning resources. While non-college platforms are frequently used, college resources remain highly valued especially when evaluated using resampled, bootstrapped data.
